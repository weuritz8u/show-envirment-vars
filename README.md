# show-envirment-vars

a simple powershell script to show envirment vars

- you need a powershell terminal installed for this! *(but on the windows it is usally installed)*

### How

- **Download the files**

- use `env-vars-to-csv.ps1` if you want to save the envirment variables in a csv file!

- then run the file with `Powershell` *(rightclick -> run with Powershell)*!
